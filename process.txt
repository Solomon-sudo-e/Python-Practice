Process: An instance of a program (e.g a python interpreter)

+Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+Seperate memory space -> memory is not shared between processes
+Great for CPU-bound processing
+New process is start independantly from other processes
+Processes are interruptable and killable
+One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation.

-Heavyweight
-Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
-More memory
-IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated.
