Threads: and entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as 'lightweight' proccess)
A process can spawn multipe threads.

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ Lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound task

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions (when two or more threads want to modify a variable at the same time which can
                        cause bugs or crashses.
