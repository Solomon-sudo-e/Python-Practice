GIL: Global interpreter lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to exdcute in python
- Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

- How to Avoid:
    - Using multiprocessing
    - Using a different, free-threaded python implementation (Jython, Ironpython)
    - Using python as a wrapper for third party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
